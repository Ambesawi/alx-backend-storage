# NoSQL Project

This project is designed to help you understand the concepts of NoSQL databases, with a focus on MongoDB, and how to work with them using Python and PyMongo.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to explain:

1. **What NoSQL means**: Understand the concept of NoSQL databases and their use cases.

2. **The difference between SQL and NoSQL**: Compare and contrast SQL and NoSQL databases.

3. **What is ACID**: Learn about the ACID properties and their role in database transactions.

4. **What is a document storage**: Understand the document-based data model used in NoSQL databases.

5. **NoSQL types**: Explore different types of NoSQL databases, such as document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph databases.

6. **Benefits of a NoSQL database**: Discover the advantages of using NoSQL databases, including scalability and flexibility.

7. **How to query information from a NoSQL database**: Learn how to retrieve data from a NoSQL database.

8. **How to insert/update/delete information from a NoSQL database**: Understand how to perform data manipulation operations in NoSQL databases.

9. **How to use MongoDB**: Get hands-on experience with MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, using Python and PyMongo.

## Requirements

### MongoDB Command File

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using MongoDB (version 4.2).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be a comment: `// my comment`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Scripts

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7) and PyMongo (version 3.10).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*).
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)`).
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`).

## More Information

For installation and specific setup details, you can refer to the [Official MongoDB Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

To get started with Python and PyMongo, you can install PyMongo using `pip3 install pymongo`.
